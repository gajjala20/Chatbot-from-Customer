# Chatbot-from-Customer(INTERNSHIP PROJECT-2)
📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a simple chatbot capable of answering basic customer queries such as business hours, location, contact information, and password reset instructions. This helps automate customer support tasks and provides users with immediate responses.

This chatbot is built using rule-based classification combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to predefined customer queries.

🧠 Project Scope & Features
Accepts user input in natural language.

Classifies the input into predefined intents using a Naive Bayes classifier.

Responds with a suitable predefined message.

Can handle queries like:

Business hours

Office location

Contact info

Password reset help

Request to talk to a human

Easy to extend with more intents and responses.

🧪 Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
Python	Programming language
NLTK	Tokenization and preprocessing
scikit-learn	Text vectorization and classification
Naive Bayes	Classification model
Bag of Words	Representing text numerically

📚 Dataset (Training Data)
The chatbot uses a manually created set of question-answer pairs to simulate training data. Each question is labeled with an intent, and each intent has a corresponding response.


🧠 NLP and Classification Pipeline
Text Preprocessing:

Uses CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert text into numerical vectors (Bag-of-Words model).

Classification:

A Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained on the vectorized questions and their corresponding intents.

Prediction:

For any user query, the model predicts the most likely intent.

The bot replies with the associated predefined response.

🛠 How It Works (Code Overview)
1. Load and Prepare Training Data
python
questions = [item["question"] for item in training_data]
intents = [item["intent"] for item in training_data]
2. Vectorize the Questions
python
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(questions)
3. Train the Classifier
python
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X, intents)
4. Predict User Input and Get Response
python
def get_response(user_input):
    X_test = vectorizer.transform([user_input])
    predicted_intent = model.predict(X_test)[0]
    return responses.get(predicted_intent, "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.")
✅ Benefits of This Chatbot
🎯 Simple and fast: Lightweight, doesn't require complex training or large datasets.

🧱 Expandable: Easy to add more intents, questions, and responses.

💡 Educational: Great introduction to NLP, classification, and chatbot design.

💬 Instant customer support: Reduces wait time for users needing basic information.

🚀 Possible Enhancements
Enhancement	Description
GUI Interface	Use Tkinter or PyQt for a graphical front-end.
Web App	Deploy as a web service using Flask or Django.
Voice Support	Use speech_recognition and pyttsx3 to enable voice input/output.
Context Awareness	Add memory or history to track previous queries.
Intent Detection via ML	Use spaCy or transformer models for better intent classification.
